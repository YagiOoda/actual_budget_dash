# Plotly Dash Actual Dashboard
A first cut of an Actual Budget dashboard using Plotly Dash and Actual sqlite files.

To run, replace the db.sqlite file in /data with your own and run app.py. This will create a webpage at 127.0.0.1:8050 where the dashboard will be located.

There are three tabs, Home, Metrics, and Investments. Currently, only Home and Metrics have any actual use. Metrics for this were inspired by https://minafi.com/spreadsheet.
